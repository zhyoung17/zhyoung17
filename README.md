## About Me

Hi! My name is Zhan Heng, and I am a 3rd Year Data Science and Economics undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I am part of the first cohort of NUS DSE-XDP students. I am also a varsity athlete and was the table tennis team's vice-captain. 

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

### HDB Machine Learning
Using decision trees and linear regression techniques, I was able to determine the key factors that lead to heightened public housing pricing in Singapore. This project was done under the guidance of my professors and was done using R. The project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/zhyoung17/hdb-ml).

### Econometrics Financial Modelling
Collaborated with a team of four and applied financial engineering techniques such as autoregression, autoregressive distribution lag, and regression forest to FED data to make a 4-step ahead prediction for GDP. I took the team lead for frontend web development using the Python Dash framework. The project website can be found [here](https://dse3101-app-tbmg7iutiq-as.a.run.app/) and the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/DSE3101/DSE3101_Project).

### Optimised Profits Of Firm Using Simulation
Implemented simulation theory to raw data and identified the most suitable car model for a large-scale car rental company, coupled with a detailed five-page findings and methodology report. Although the results of the project were not released, I was awarded an A for the module, most likely because of the project.
